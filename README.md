# SERP Content Brief Generator Documentation

## Overview
The SERP Content Brief Generator is a powerful tool designed to help SEO professionals and content strategists scrape SEO-related tags from top-ranking sites for a specific keyword and generate a hyper-optimized content brief using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.

## Features
- Fetch top-ranking sites for a specific keyword using SERPer Dev API.
- Scrape specified HTML tags (e.g., h1, h2, h3, p) from these sites.
- Consolidate the scraped data.
- Generate a hyper-optimized content brief using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

## Additional Notes
